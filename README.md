 05-09-2023 - Two-Tiered Navigation Menu - Fully Responsive

The mobile-menu slides up and down from the bottom of the screen. 

The problem is, when the mobile menu is "closed" - you can see it when you scroll down!


Maybe try adding a brief delay and then do a display: none to completely hide it when it's off screen?


More research & experimentation needed here.
